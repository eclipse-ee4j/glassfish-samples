<h1>Sample Batch application demonstrating JobOperator APIs</h1>

<p>This sample demonstrates how to use the <code>jakarta.batch.operations.JobOperator</code>
   interface to submit batch jobs.</p>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>This sample application demonstrates how to use the Batch Processing API (JSR 352)
   to submit batch jobs and how to obtain information about submitted jobs using the
   <code>JobOperator</code> interface. This sample also demostrates how to perform
   batch processing using multiple partitioned chunks. </p>

The job xml contains one step called 'process'. This step uses three batch artifacts:
<ul>
    <li>PayrollPartitionMapper (that implements PartitionMapper) is a class that tells
	the Batch runtime about the number of partitions that must be created and also
	the set of partition specific input data. This is communicated to the Batch
	Runtime by returing a PartitionPlanImpl from the mapPartitions() method.

	<p>The PayrollPartitionMapper creates 5 partitions to process 30 payroll records.
	Each Partition is run on a separate thread by the Batch runtime, but each Partition
	runs the same Chunk (meaning same ItemReader, same ItemWriter and same ItemProcessor).
	In order to let each Partition to work on different payroll records, the PayrollPartitionMapper
	sets the starting and ending employee numbers that each Partitioned step must process.</li>
    <li>SimpleItemReader (that implements ItemReader): An ItemReader reads input records. The
        Batch runtime calls ItemReader.readItem() to read input records. The ItemReader can
        read input records from a variety of sources like Database, a CSV flat file, from
        another JavaEE component etc. Each record that is read from a ItemReader is handed
        to an ItemProcessor.
        <p>In this sample, the SimpleItemReader reads PayrollInputRecord(s) from a Singleton bean.</p></li>
    <li>SimpleItemProcessor (that implements ItemProcessor): An ItemProcessor processes an input
        record and returns (possibly a different) output record. The Batch runtime calls
        ItemProcessor.processItem() to process the record that was read by ItemReader.
        <p>In this sample, SimpleItemProcessor receives PayrollInputRecord (from the batch runtime),
            computes the net pay and returns a PayrollRecord (to the batch runtime). The batch
            runtime then calls ItemWriter</p></li>
    <li>SimpleItemWriter (that implements ItemWriter): An ItemWrites writes the output record
        to some datastore. The datastore can range from Database, a CSV flat file, to another
        JavaEE component. The Batch runtime calls ItemWriter.writeItems()
        to write the records that were processed by ItemWriter.
        <p>In this sample, SimpleItemWriter stores the processed PayrollRecord into an
            EJB Singleton bean.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The sample uses the embedded JavaDB database service included with the Glassfish server.</p>
<p>The sample is built and deployed as a WAR file.</p>


<h2>Key Features</h2>
<p>This sample application demonstrates the following key features:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Defining a batch job using a job XML file.</li>
    <li>Using the method <code>JobOperator.start()</code> to submit a batch job. This method returns the execution id for the job execution</li>
    <li>Using the method <code>JobOperator.getJobInstances()</code> method to obtain all JobInstabnces for the "payroll" job</li>
    <li>Using the method <code>jobOperator.getJobInstances()</code> to get a list of job instances submitted by this application.</li>
    <li>Using the method <code>jobOperator.getJobExecutions(jobInstance)</code> to get a list of <code>JobExecution</code> objects.</li>
    <li>Working with <code>JobExecution</code> objects:</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Using the method <code>JobExecution.getJobName()</code> to get the job name.</li>
        <li>Using the method <code>JobExecution.getBatchStatus()</code> to get the batch status of the job execution.</li>
        <li>Using the method <code>JobExecution.getExitStatus()</code> to get the exit status of the job execution.</li>
        <li>Using the method <code>JobExecution.getStartTime()</code> to obtain the time when the job execution started.</li>
        <li>Using the method <code>JobExecution.getEndTime()</code> to obtain the time when the job execution completed.</li>
    </ul>
</ul>

<h2>Building, Deploying, and Running the Application</h2>
<!-- Modify this section as needed -->
<p>Perform the following steps to build, deploy, and run the application:</p>
<ol>
    <li> Set up your build environment and configure the application server with which the build system has to work by following
        the <a href="../../../docs/UserREADME.html">common build instructions.</a></li>
    <li><code><i>samples_install_dir</i></code> is the sample application base directory. Go to: <code><i>samples_install_dir</i>/jakartaee9/batch/joboperator-api</code>.
    </li>
    <li>Build the sample application by running <code>mvn package</code> command from a command line terminal.</li>
    <li>Deploy the sample application by running <code>asadmin deploy --force target/partition.war</code> command from a command line terminal.</li>
    <li>The front page of this sample is at <a href="http://localhost:8080/partition/PartitionedJobSubmitterServlet">http://localhost:8080/joboperator-api/PayrollJobSubmitterServlet</a>.
        (The port number might vary.)</li>
    <li>Use <code>mvn clean</code> command from a command line terminal to clean up the target directory.</li>
    <li>Undeploy the sample application by running <code>asadmin undeploy partition</code> command from a command line terminal.</li>
    </li>
</ol>
