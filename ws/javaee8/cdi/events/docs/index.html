        <h1>The Events CDI Sample Application</h1>
        <p>Contexts & Dependency Injection (JSR 299) defines a standards-based, 
type-safe Dependency Injection mechanism in the Java EE platform. The 
type-safety comes from the fact that no <code>String</code>-based identifiers are 
used to identify the dependencies and instead all the information is 
specified using the Java object model. The loose coupling is possible 
because the bean requesting injection need not be aware of the 
lifecycle, concrete implementation, threading model, and similar details 
of the injected bean. The CDI runtime automatically figures out the 
right bean in the right scope and context and then injects it correctly 
for the requestor.</p>
<p>
CDI Events take loose coupling to the next level by following the Observer 
pattern. Event producers raise events that are consumed by observers. 
The event object carries state from producer to consumer. The producer
can fire the events and observer can specify qualifiers to narrow the set of
events received.
</p>

        <h2>Description</h2>
This sample illustrates how stateless EJBs can produce events and how
singleton EJB can consume them. As EJBs in Java EE are also POJOs they
have all the characteristics of a CDI bean as well. 
The sample uses a <code>PrintServlet</code> to invoke a print page stateless EJB. The
bean fires events based upon the number of pages. These events are then consumed
by the <code>PrintObserver</code> bean and a statement is printed out.
</p>

<p>The following code snippet shows how <code>PrintProducer</code> fires events:
</p>

<pre>
@Inject Event&lt;PrintEvent&gt; printEvent;
@Inject @BindIt Event&lt;PrintEvent&gt; printAndBindEvent;

public void print(int pages) {
    PrintEvent event = new PrintEvent(pages);
    if (pages < 10)
        printEvent.fire(event);
    else
        printAndBindEvent.fire(event);
}
</pre>
<p>The following code snippet shows how <code>PrintObserver</code> consumes events:
</p>
<pre>
public void onPrintAndBind(@Observes @BindIt PrintEvent event) {
    System.out.println("Printing and binding " + event.getPages() + " pages");
}

public void onPrint(@Observes @Default PrintEvent event) {
    System.out.println("Printing " + event.getPages() + " pages");
}
</pre>
<p>

        <h2>Building, Deploying, and Running the Application</h2>
        <!-- Modify this section as needed -->
        <p>Perform the following steps to build, deploy, and run the application:</p>
        <ol>
            <li> Set up your build environment and configure the application server with which the build system has to work by following the <a href="../../../docs/UserREADME.html">common build instructions.</a></li>
            <li><code><i>app_dir</i></code> is the sample application base directory: <code><i>samples_install_dir</i>/javaee8/cdi/events</code>.</li>
            <li>Change directory to <code><i>app_dir.</i></code></li>
            <li>Build, deploy, and run the sample application using the <code>run</code> outcome.
                <p><code>mvn clean verify cargo:run</code></p>
            </li>
            <li>Use the <code>clean</code> outcome to undeploy the sample application and to remove the temporary directories such as <code>build</code> and <code>dist</code>.
                <p><code>mvn clean</code></p>
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Troubleshooting</h2>
        <p>If you have problems when running the application, refer to the <a href="../../../docs/UserTroubleShooting.html">troubleshooting document</a>.</p>
