## Jakarta  EE 8 Sample Applications README

This README file contains step-by-step instructions which can be used to create new sample projects for Jakarta  EE 8 sample application workspace. Also describes how to add a new example.


Jakarta  EE 8 samples workspace is in `jakartaee8` subdirectory.

To create a new Jakarta  EE 8 sample application:

* Create the `pom.xml` file for sample group. For instance, `jakartaee8/cdi/pom.xml`. Use one of existing sample group poms for reference, for instance `jakartaee8/jsf/pom.xml`. Adjust artifact name to match the technology name and new version.

* Create the `pom.xml` file for the individual module using one of existing module poms as reference. Most of the sample apps should create Maven `war` module. It should be sufficient to use `javaee-api` as the only compile time dependency, with "provided" scope. At the end of this document you will find several links to Maven plugin and pom documentation which may be useful for this step.

* Under the application module directory create subdirectories for sample documents and code. Most samples will need these subdirectories:
 	+ `src/docs`
 	+ `src/main/java`
 	+ `src/main/resources`
 	+ `src/main/webapp`

* At this point, you should be able to run `mvn install` from the module directory and build the application. Resulting war file will be present in the `target` subdirectory.

	To run your application, you can deploy it manually to a GlassFish instance using asadmin. The recommended method of telling users of the sample how to deploy it is to use Cargo. The top-level pom.xml is configured with the [Cargo](http://cargo.codehaus.org/) maven plugin. There are several ways to use it:

	+ Run it using the `cargo:run` goal - this downloads a GlassFish build from the public web site, installs it under the target directory, creates a domain, starts the server, and deploys the application.
	+ To use a local glassfish.zip file, provide a value for the cargo.maven.containerUrl property. For example: `-Dcargo.maven.containerUrl=file:$HOME/test/glassfish/glassfish.zip`
	+ To run it using an already installed GlassFish, provide a value for the glassfish.home property. For example: `-Dglassfish.home=$HOME/test/glassfish/glassfish5`

	Besides the `cargo:run` goal, which runs the application in the foreground, you can also use the `cargo:start` goal which will create a domain, start the server in the background and deploy the application. The `cargo:stop` goal can be used to stop the domain.

	If your sample requires additional configuration, such as a database, security realms, etc., make sure to configure those requirements properly. 

	If the client of your sample is a standalone Java application, you can use `org.codehaus.mojo:exec-maven-plugin:exec` to run the Java client. Take `ejb/automatic-timer/automatic-timer-client/pom.xml` for example, this sample uses exec-maven-plugin plugin to run a remote EJB client. And the client depends on the local gf-client.jar. This jar and the directory of `target/classes` will be placed on classpath when run the client.

* If things work (or at least build), add your content to the repository and commit it. If you are unable to commit changes, you may have insufficient project privileges and in that case please contact one of project owners.

* Please note, cargo does not support GlassFish container above version 4.x,but using latest GlassFish source which is of version 5.0, all the existing tests runs fine. The location of the GlassFish source may change based on the actual release version and in that case, the base pom.xml has to be modified.
