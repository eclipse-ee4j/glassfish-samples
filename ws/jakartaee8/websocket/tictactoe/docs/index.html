        <h1>The Tic-tac-toe WebSocket Sample Application</h1>
		<p>This sample application is a Tic-tac-toe game that demonstrates how to use the Java API for WebSocket.</p>

        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
			This sample application is a Tic-tac-toe game that demonstrates how to use the basic features of the Java API for Websocket.
			The application consists of a client and a server, and it uses the client API and the server API from JSR-356. 
			The client is built with <a href='http://docs.oracle.com/javafx/index.html'>JavaFx</a>, and it is located in the 
			<code>org.glassfish.samples.tictactoe.client</code> package. The server is a WebSocket endpoint as defined in JSR-356, and it
			is located in the <code>org.glassfish.samples.tictactoe.server</code> package.
		</p>
		<p>
			In this sample, two client instances create WebSocket connections to communicate with the server endpoint, which acts
			like a hub. The server endpoint handles the interactions between the two clients. Once there is a winner, the clients
			close the connection, and the <code>onClose()</code> method of the server endpoint is invoked.
		</p>
		<p>
			This sample shows how to use the WebSocket Client API in Java and how to create a WebSocket connection from a standalone
			client application and to server endpoint.
		<p>
		<p>
			<b>Note:</b> Unlike the rest of the WebSocket samples, this sample does not use JavaScript code in an HTML page
			to connect to a server endpoint.
		</p>


        <h2>Key Features</h2>
		<p>This sample demonstrates the following key features:</p>
		<ul>
		  <li>
		    <p>How to obtain a WebSocket container instance and how to connect to and endpoint from a Java client.</p>
			<p>The following code is from <code>TicTacToeClient.java</code>:</p>
			<pre>
private void startGame() throws URISyntaxException, DeploymentException, IOException {
   WebSocketContainer container = ContainerProvider.getWebSocketContainer();
   container.connectToServer(LocalEndpoint.class, null, new URI(SERVER));
}
			</pre>
		  </li>
		  <li>
		    <p>How to implement a client endpoint in a Java client.</p>
			<p>The following code is from <code>LocalEndpoint.java</code>:</p>
			<pre>
@Override
public void onOpen(Session session, EndpointConfig config) {
   ...
}

@Override
public void onMessage(final String message) {
   ...
}
		    </pre>
			<p>The client endpoint class overrides two methods: <code>onOpen</code> and <code>onMessage</code>.
			   The <code>onOpen</code> method is invoked when the WebSocket connection is established.
			   The <code>onMessage</code> method is invoked when the client endpoints receives a message.
			   These two methods serve the same purpose as their equivalents in the JavaScript WebSocket API.
			</p>
	      </li>
		  <li>
		    <p>How to implement a server endpoint in Java EE. The server endpoint uses WebSocket annotations 
			as demonstrated in the other WebSocket sample applications.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Building, Deploying, and Running the Application</h2>
        <!-- Modify this section as needed -->
        <p>Perform the following steps to build, deploy, and run the application:</p>
        <ol>
            <li> Set up your build environment and configure the application server with which the build system has to work by following the <a href="../../../docs/UserREADME.html">common build instructions.</a></li>
            <li><code><i>app_dir</i></code> is the sample application base directory: <code><i>samples_install_dir</i>/jakartaee8/websocket/tictactoe</code>.</li>
            <li>Build, deploy, and run the <b>server</b> application using the <code>run</code> outcome.
                <p>
                    <code>cd server</code>
                </p>
                <p><code>mvn clean verify cargo:run</code></p>
            </li>
            <li>
                Before running the client application, you should make sure JavaFx library has been installed into local maven repository.
                <p>
                    The following commands are going to install the JavaFx library into local maven repository:
                </p>
                <p>
                    <code>
                        mvn install:install-file -Dfile=$JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/jfxrt.jar -DgroupId=com.oracle -DartifactId=javafx -Dversion=2.2 -Dpackaging=jar
                    </code>
                </p>
                <p><b>Note: </b> <code>$JAVA_HOME</code> is point to JDK repository</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                Run the client standalone application. You need two client endpoints. To obtain two client instances,
				type the following commands in two different terminal windows:
                <p>
                    <code>cd app_dir/client</code> 
                </p>
                <p>
                    <code>mvn clean install</code>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Note: </b>You get two 3*3 chessboard dialogs if the sample runs successfully. 
					Follow the instructions on the user interface to play Tic-tac-toe.</br> 
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you get any <b>exceptions</b> from JavaFX, ensure that the client 
					<code>pom.xml</code> contains the correct <b>PATH</b> to <code>jfxrt.jar</code>.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>Use the <code>clean</code> outcome to undeploy the sample application and to remove the temporary directories such as <code>build</code> and <code>dist</code>.
                <p><code>mvn clean</code></p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <b>Note: </b> In NetBeans IDE, open the sample application projects (client and server) and use the IDE to build and run them.

        <h2>Troubleshooting</h2>
        <p>If you have problems when running the application, refer to the <a href="../../../docs/UserTroubleShooting.html">troubleshooting document</a>.</p>
