        <h1>The Asynchronous Chat JAX-RS Sample Application</h1>
        <p>This sample application uses JAX-RS asynchronous features to implement a simple 
		producer/consumer chat.</p>

        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This sample demonstrates how to use <code>javax.ws.rs.container.AsyncResponse</code>. 
		    The deployed resource (<code>ChatResource</code>) contains two asynchronous methods.
            These methods have a response annotated with <code>@AsyncResponse</code> and run
            in the suspended mode. In this mode, the response is not returned from the resource method
			as a return value but must be resumed by calling the <code>AsyncResponse.resume()</code> method. 
			Before the response is resumed, the execution thread is returned back to container.
        </p>
        <p>
            The resource method that receives messages (<code>ChatResource.getMesssage()</code>) stores 
			the asynchronous response in a blocking queue. After the message is sent to server 
			(<code>ChatResource.posMesssage()</code>), the asynchronous response of the request that is waiting
            for message is taken from the queue and resumed with the message. Instead of keeping messages in 
			the queue, the queue stores the responses waiting for these messages, and the messages are directly 
			delivered to these response when they are available.
        </p>
        <p>The front page shows the text input field for a message. Enter a message and click  on
		<code>POST MESSAGE</code>. The POST request is sent to the server where it is blocked in the 
		queue until a message is requested.</p> 
		<p>After sending a message, click on <code>GET MESSAGE</code>, which sends a 
		background asynchronous GET request to the server. This request will be suspended and 
        resumed later with the message from the POST request that is stored in the blocking queue. 
		The message is sent back to the browser and displayed in the box below the 
		<code>GET MESSAGE</code> button.</p>
		<p>If you click the buttons in the opposite order, 
        the GET request is suspended waiting to be resumed by an incoming POST request.
        </p>
        <p>The page also contains the field with the status of an asynchronous queue 
		that is stored in <code>ChatResource</code>. This
            field is automatically refreshed in short intervals by calling the GET method on 
			<code>/chat/queue</code> from <code>ChatResource</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
        You can only send one GET and one POST request to the server from the page 
		(the buttons are then disabled). To submit more
        GET and POST requests, open new browser windows. The screen also contains a 
		log of the asynchronous requests submitted by the browser.</p>


        <h2>Key Features</h2>
		<p>This sample application demonstrates the following key features:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><code>@AsyncResponse</code></li>
            <li><code>@Path</code></li>
			<li><code>@Singleton</code></li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Building, Deploying, and Running the Application</h2>
        <!-- Modify this section as needed -->
        <p>Perform the following steps to build, deploy, and run the application:</p>
        <ol>
            <li> Set up your build environment and configure the application server with which the build system has to work by following the <a href="../../../docs/UserREADME.html">common build instructions.</a></li>
            <li><code><i>samples_install_dir</i></code> is the sample application base directory. Go to: <code><i>samples_install_dir</i>/jakartaee8/rest/async-chat</code>.</li>
            <li>Build, deploy, and run the sample application using the <code>run</code> outcome.
                <p><code>mvn clean verify cargo:run</code></p>
            </li>
            <li>The front page of this sample is at 
			<code>http://localhost:8080/async-chat</code>.<br/>
			(The port number might vary.)</li>
            <li>Use the <code>clean</code> outcome to undeploy the sample application and to remove the temporary directories such as <code>build</code> and <code>dist</code>.
                <p><code>mvn clean</code></p>
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Troubleshooting</h2>
        <p>If you have problems when running the application, refer to the <a href="../../../docs/UserTroubleShooting.html">troubleshooting document</a>.</p>
