   <h1>JSF 2.2 File Upload Samples</h1>
   <article>
      <p>This sample demonstrates the use of a simple file upload component introduced in JSF 2.2.<br/>
         One option demonstrates a traditional file upload operation, while the other option<br/>
         demonstrates a file upload operation over Ajax.<br/>
         For both options, Click on the "Browse" button and navigate to the<br/>
         <i>jakartaee8/jsf/fileupload</i> directory.  choose one of <i>inputFileFailure.txt</i> or <br/>
         <i>inputFileSuccess.txt .</i>  Then press the <i>Upload</i> button.  There is a validator
         attached to the file input component that examines the contents of the uploaded file, <br/>
         looking for the string <i>JSR-344</i>.  The <i>inputFileFailure.txt</i> file does not contain<br/>
         the string so you should see a validation error: <i>Invalid file. File must contain special string</i><br/>
         The <i>inputFileSuccess.txt</i> file contains the JSR-344 string so you should see a success message: <br/>
         <i>This file contains the string JSR-344 and will be successfully set into the model.</i></p>
